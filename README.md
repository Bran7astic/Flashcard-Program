# Smart-Sprites-

## Inspiration
Flashcards are an extremely helpful learning tool that not not everyone takes advantage of, so we wanted to create a simple and easy-to-use flashcard program called Smart Sprites!!

## What it does
Smart Sprites has several main functionalities, allowing you to create, remove, edit, and view all your flashcards. It also has a randomized quiz option, where flashcard terms will be presented at random, and the definition is not unveiled until the card is flipped, encouraging the user to quiz themselves.

## How we built it
We built Smart Sprites using Python in the Replit IDE in order to collaborate with each other in real time while also being able to push our changes to GitHub effortlessly.

## Challenges we ran into
Creating the main while loop was slightly more difficult than we expected, as we had to think about what points we'd have to redirect to the main loop for each and every function. Not every function required redirecting back to the main loop prematurely, but we had to put some extra thought into ones that did to make sure the experience was as smooth and logical as possible.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're very proud of how the randomize feature came out! It looks to be a very helpful tool that encourages users to think about the definition of a term before they see it all whilst being able to track their progress. We really like that it provides a percentage score at the end, which gives a visible goal users can work towards surpassing!

## What we learned
We learned how to make effective use of Python's dictionaries in order to store data and access them in various ways, whether it's viewing them all at once in an easily understandable format, or randomizing them!

## What's next for Study Sprites!
We envision that the user experience of Study Sprites would be greatly enhanced by a GUI, so creating a visible interface is the next step!
